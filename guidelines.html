                  This guidance document is designed to help government officials from ASEAN Member States to complete the Alignment Assessment Tool for the <b><i>ASEAN Guidelines on Promoting Responsible Investment in Food, Agriculture and Forestry</i></b>(ASEAN-RAI). Completing the Alignment Assessment Tool can help AMS officials determine the extent to which their country's legal, policy, and institutional frameworks are aligned with the ASEAN-RAI. This guidance document should be read before starting the assessment. The assessment starts with a self-assessment, followed by an independent review by two ASEAN Member States. A scoring system provides a simple measure to assess the degree of alignment of a country's legal, policy and institutional framework to the ASEAN-RAI. Further instructions on the use of the Alignment Assessment Tool are found in the Excel spreadsheet containing the Tool.

                  <p>
                    This guidance document is designed to assist government officials from ASEAN Member State (AMS) to complete the <b><i>Alignment Assessment Tool for the ASEAN Guidelines on Promoting Responsible Investment in Food, Agriculture and Forestry</i></b>(the ASEAN-RAI). Completing the Alignment Assessment Tool can help AMS officials determine the extent to which their country's legal, policy, and institutional frameworks are aligned with the
                    ASEAN-RAI. It can also help to identify gaps where reforms may be needed, or new policy actions could be prioritized, to better implement the ASEAN-RAI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Alignment Assessment Tool focuses on actions to be taken by AMS, as set out in the ASEAN-RAI under the heading 'To achieve this, AMS may consider....' (and which we refer to as the 'sub - guidelines'). In this document, under each sub - guideline is a set of explanations, prompt questions, and examples to help clarify and unpack the substance of each sub - guideline, and help users determine whether it has been implemented by an AMS through its legal, policy and institutional frameworks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because of the nature of the ASEAN-RAI as voluntary guiding principles with practical examples, each guideline could be implemented in several different ways.<sup id="sup_1"><a href="#foot_1">1</a></sup>
                    As such, this guidance is intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive in nature, showing just some of theways in which a guideline could be aligned to with a national legal, policy or institutional framework. By providing these questions and examples, this guidance is intended to prompt
                    the user to consider other ways in which a guideline may be implemented in their country.
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="mb-4">How to carry out the Alignment Assessment Tool process</h4>
                  <p>
                    The ASEAN-RAI are a comprehensive and cross-cutting instrument which touches on most aspects of government and relates to the work of a wide range of government agencies, departments, and ministries within AMS. As such, to complete the assessment process may take several days and may be carried most efficiently through a cross-government workshop. In some instances, the information required may be published by sources outside of the government who track and map policies, such as those set out in Annex I.

Nor do they replace the need for improved legal and policy frameworks at the national level. Indeed, a stronger and more equitable regulatory environment at the national level is the best guarantee to achieve social, economic and environmental benefits from investment.'(p.6)
